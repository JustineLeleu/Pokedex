# Pokedex

Develop a Pokedex application using PHP procedural programming. The application should have an index.php page displaying a list of Pokemon. Users should be able to click on a Pokemon to view its details and evolution. Additionally, implement an user authentication system with a login and registration page, allowing users to save their favorite Pokemon.

This project was made in november 2023 during a formation at BeCode.
